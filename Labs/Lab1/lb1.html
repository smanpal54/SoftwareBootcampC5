		<p>I am taking this course to learn a new skill and eventually use it for a career. I always wanted to learn how to build websites and make one of my own but I didn't know how to start. I was into fashion before but when covid happened I saw a lot of more potential on learning how to code because I was at home during lockdown and I had all the technology I needed. One thing I love doing is building cars and I have fun doing so. I enjoy building things the way I want it to be and I want to build my own website the way I want it to be.</p>
